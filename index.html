      <h1>Ancure Health</h1>

      <p>
        Ancure Health is a <strong>privacy-first digital health platform</strong> designed
        to help users understand their menstrual cycles, recognize body patterns,
        and build long-term preventive health awareness.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Ancure Health Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Modern healthcare generates massive amounts of data, yet very little
        understanding. Reports are confusing, early symptoms are ignored, and
        preventive care is often missing. Ancure Health was built to bridge this gap
        using medically grounded logic and simple technology.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Can Do on Ancure Health</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Track menstrual cycles and period history</li>
        <li>Estimate ovulation and fertile windows</li>
        <li>Log symptoms and cycle irregularities</li>
        <li>Build meaningful health history for doctor consultations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy and Medical Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Ancure Health does <strong>not provide diagnoses</strong> and does not replace
        medical professionals. It exists to support awareness, early pattern recognition,
        and informed healthcare decisions. User data is never sold.
